Compress/LeadingBlankSpaces version 0.03
========================================

=head1 NAME

Compress::LeadingBlankSpaces - Perl class to compress leading blank spaces in (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) web content.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides the functionality for the most simple web content compression.

Basically, the outgoing web content (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) contains a lot of leading blank spaces,
because of being structured on development stage.
Usually, the client browser ignores leading blank spaces.
Indeed, the amount of those blank spaces is as significant
as 10 to 20 percent of the length of regular web page.
We can reduce this part of web traffic on busy servers
with no visible impact on transferred web content,
especially for those old browsers, which fail to understand the modern content compression.

The main functionality of this class is concentrated within the C<squeeze_string> member function
that is supposed to be used inside the data transfer loop on server side.
The rest of the class is developed to serve possible exceptions, like pre-formatted data within HTML.

In this version of the class, the tags those produce compression exceptions are:

E<lt>PREE<gt> ...  E<lt>/PREE<gt>

E<lt>TEXTAREA<gt> ... E<lt>/TEXTAREA<gt>

All are case insensitive in implementation.
