Compress/LeadingBlankSpaces version 0.01
========================================

=head1 NAME

Compress::LeadingBlankSpaces - Perl class to compress leading blank spaces in (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) web content.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides the functionality for the most simple web content compression.

Basically, the outgoing web content (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) consists of many leading blank spaces,
because of being structured on development stage.
Usually, the client browser ignores leading blank spaces.
Indeed, the amount of those blank spaces is big enough,
and could be estimated as 10 to 20 percent of the length of regular commercial web page.
We can reduce this part of web traffic on busy production servers
with no visible impact on transferred web content,
especially for those old browsers who do not understand the modern content compression, like gzip format.

The main functionality of this class is concentrated within the C<squeeze_string> member function,
which is supposed to be used inside the data transfer loop on server side.
The rest of the class is developed to serve possible exceptions, like pre-formatted data within HTML.

In this version of the class, the only one tag produces compression exceptions:

E<lt>PREE<gt>
 ...
E<lt>/PREE<gt>

which is case insensitive in implementation.
